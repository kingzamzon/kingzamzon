I am a Backend Developer focus on PHP/Laravel and JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js. Though I believe languages are tools and using the right tools bring the best result. I am an active learner cause I believe "Everyday is another day to be a better version of myself, better version of the yesterday me across various stacks in tech"
